# Pet-management system. 
I have developed an intricately designed pet management system that enables users to effortlessly book or cancel a wide range of pet services based on their preferences. 
The system boasts an aesthetically pleasing front-end interface, meticulously crafted using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience. 
On the backend, the system leverages the power of MongoDB, a versatile and scalable NoSQL database, coupled with Node.js, a high-performance JavaScript runtime environment. 
This sophisticated architecture enables efficient storage and retrieval of data, empowering users to effortlessly manage their pet-related services with utmost convenience.
